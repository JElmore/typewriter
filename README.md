## Theme Development

TypeWriter uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). This improves the development flow, and makes it much faster.

First make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run the following commands in the theme root directory to install npm dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

To start Gulp, run:

```bash
gulp
```

This builds the theme and watches for changes; as you edit files in the src directory, Gulp will update the build automatically.

To package the theme for upload to Ghost, run:

```bash
gulp package
```
