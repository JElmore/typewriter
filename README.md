### Theme Development

TypeWriter is using [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). This improve the development flow, and making it much faster.

First make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run the the following commands in the theme root directory to install npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

To start Gulp, run:

```
gulp
```

This will compile Sass, and start watching changes as you edit files.
